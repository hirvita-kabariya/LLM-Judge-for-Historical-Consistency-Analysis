<hi rend="underscore">From Abraham Lincoln to Truman Smith<anchor id="i80">1</anchor>, November 10, 1860</hi>
</p>
<p>
<note anchor.ids="i80">1 See Smith to Lincoln, November 7, 1860, and Smith to Lincoln, November 8, 1860.  Smith called Lincoln's attention to a circular distributed before the election by ârespectable citizens of New York,â in which Lincoln was held up as a dangerous radical and an enemy of the institutions of the South and of the peace and security of the Union, whose policies were unsettling to the commercial life of the country.  Such a message, typical as it was of the sort of vituperation a presidential candidate must endure, was especially unsettling in the current campaign, and would have a negative influence in the South as well as among Northern voters.  Once elected, Smith asked, should Lincoln not speak out to âdisarm the mischief makers, to allay causeless anxiety, to compose the public mind...?â</note>

<hi rend="underscore">Private &amp; Confidential</hi>.</p>
<p>Springfield Ill Nov 10th 1860.</p>
<p>My dear Sir</p>
<p>This is intended as a strictly private letter to you, and not as an answer to yours brought me by Mr. Sanford.<anchor id="i81">2</anchor>  It is with the most profound appreciation of your motive, and highest respect for your judgment too, that I feel constrained, for the present, at least, to make no declaration for the public.</p>
<p>
<note anchor.ids="i81">2 Smith's first letter to Lincoln, of November 7, 1860, was carried by Henry S. Sanford.  See Smith to Lincoln, November 8, 1860.</note>
</p>
<p>First, I could say nothing which I have not already said, and which is in print, and open for the inspection of all.  To press a repetition of this upon those who <hi rend="underscore">have</hi> listened, is useless; to press it upon those who have <hi rend="underscore">refused</hi> to listen, and still refuse, would be wanting in self-respect, and would have an appearance of sycophancy and timidity, which would excite the contempt of good men, and encourage bad ones to clamor the more loudly.</p>
<p>I am not insensible to any commercial or financial depression that may exist; but nothing is to be gained by fawning around the â<hi rend="underscore">respectable scoundrels</hi>â who got it up.  Let them go to work and repair the mischief of their own making; and then perhaps they will be less greedy to do the like again.</p>
<p>Yours very truly</p>
<p>A. Lincoln.</p>
