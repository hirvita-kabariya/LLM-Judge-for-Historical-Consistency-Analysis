[*?*] [*H*]

To the President &
Atty Genl of the U.S.
Learning that E. M. 
Norton Marshal of the District Court of the
United States for the District of West Va. has -
resigned, or contemplates resigning the office
of Marshal - it affords me pleasure to recommend
to the favorable consideration of -
your Excellencies - as Mr Nortons successor
Samuel McCullough Esqr. of Wheeling -
Mr. McCullough is thoroughly loyal - has served
over three years in the U. S. Army with
honor to himself, evidenced and acknowledged
by promotions - has been reared in
the Clerk's office of his County and is familiar
with business - is a good businessman,
and will fill the office I am
sure, to the satisfaction of all.
I take the liberty of troubling you
with this letter, because of information

[*43618*]
[*[ac9555]*]

that there are, or will be applicants for the
position, who, in this latitude, are known
as Copper heads - or Conservative. - Constitutional
men - We in this region want & 
need only thoroughly loyal sources in
official positions.  And in our US. Courts
we cant afford any farther dilution
of the true elements - or what should
be a power in the land for good
may prove only a dead weight
or even an engine of Evil -
I trust you may be pleased to
appoint Mr. McCullough to the position
of Mr. Nortons successor
as Marshal. -    Yours truly
E. B. Hall
Atty. Genl. of W. Va
